## Implementation
### How did you do it? Pipeline, execution details, etc.
I used the Vuforia package of Unity for creating the AR interaction. It's very easy to use, and to upload my version to an android phone. 
The main problem was to find the perfect marker.
I downloaded an already existing very simple rainbow 3d model, on one hand, because it was easier, on the other hand I like how simple it looks.

## Project Reflection & Discussion
### What worked well, what didn't work and why? In which context does your project stand? Future Work?
#### What worked well:
- I really like my concept, and whoever I told my idea, they found it very sharp and on-point.
- I'm glad I've spent a lot of time on thinking about the concept, it started from Gábor's idea with flags and computer vision, and I've spent a lot of time considering different platforms and interaction options. I think the current version is the most simple version in a good way, in terms of meaning and user interaction.
- I especially like the turning a historical object into an AR protest, and I'm very sad that the execution is not legally possible. 
- changing to plan B is an easier and cheaper option for execution
- I tried to solve everything with only asking for opinion from other people, but without asking for hands-on help, which is good for my personal development. 

#### What didn't work well:
- I could have started making the rainbow and the technical part already in Berlin
- that it's forbidden to take photos about the crown, and I think that was my main interest in the project
- my time management
- I always do the easier / non-technical things first, and it makes the technical parts even more stressful
- the project is very site-specific, which makes it harder to execute things, and having a work station a bit far from the site is uncomfortable

#### Future work:
- to make a version which is accessible for anybody on iphone and android as well
- to put it on the app store
- to make 444 (one of the main independent Hungarian news portals) to write about it
- it's an option to make a nicer rainbow


## Lessons Learned
- I've been joyful about working on the project, which is a better state of mind then being stressed
