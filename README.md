# ARainbow- szivÁRvány
with Gábor Ott

## Concept
### Background 
The Hungarian government is not too openminded. Their new law forbidding to talk about any LGBTQ topic to people under 18 years created even more violance towards people, even just putting a rainbow flag on their balcony.  
### Idea
My dear friend and copywriter mate, Gábor Ott, had the idea to create an app where people can turn any flag into a rainbow flag in Augmented Reality. 
We are still developing the concept, but even just placing rainbows in Augmented reality to express solidarity can create a little change. 
### Plan
to create an app, where you can put rainbows to connect two places.
GPS based.
