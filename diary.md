## Beginning of summer
My friend, Gábor Ott, wrote me that he has an idea to create an app which turns any flag into a rainbow flag. I liked the idea, and I asked my classmates if they would want to work on such a thing, but we were busy with 48h NK and Sehsüchte. The idea came back to me more and more often, the worse and worse news I read related to the Hungarian government's LGBTQ laws, and how it increased aggressivity towards people even just putting rainbow flags on their balcony.
With another friend we have been thinking about an AR protest group exhibition for a while, but we are talking a lot, but we enjoy laughing about things more.

It has been also a question on which platform it would be good ot make an exhibition. For a groupshow Adobe Aero would be good, because even 2d artists can easily create with it, but it's not a good platform for exhibiting.

Brainstorming with Gábor.Our idea is that it would be cool to have a marker, which can not be easily removed. I remembered my friends' AR exhibition where they used the shadow of a plant as a marker. We are thinking about that if it's just one very well placed rainbow, that's already good. We think about what can be the marker around the Parlament. We also had the idea that how cool it could be if the marker is the Holy Crown. It is in the parliament, and visitors can see it. And what could be a more powerful sign than the holy crown, the symbol of the unity of Hungary having a rainbow.

Research on the crown.
