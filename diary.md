## Beginning of summer
My friend, Gábor Ott, wrote me that he has an idea to create an app which turns any flag into a rainbow flag. I liked the idea, and I asked my classmates if they would want to work on such a thing, but we were busy with 48h NK and Sehsüchte. The idea came back to me more and more often, the worse and worse news I read related to the Hungarian government's LGBTQ laws, and how it increased aggressivity towards people even just putting rainbow flags on their balcony.
With another friend we have been thinking about an AR protest group exhibition for a while, but we are talking a lot, but we enjoy laughing about things more.

It has been also a question on which platform it would be good ot make an exhibition. For a groupshow Adobe Aero would be good, because even 2d artists can easily create with it, but it's not a good platform for exhibiting.

Brainstorming with Gábor.Our idea is that it would be cool to have a marker, which can not be easily removed. I remembered my friends' AR exhibition where they used the shadow of a plant as a marker. We are thinking about that if it's just one very well placed rainbow, that's already good. We think about what can be the marker around the Parlament. We also had the idea that how cool it could be if the marker is the Holy Crown. It is in the parliament, and visitors can see it. And what could be a more powerful sign than the holy crown, the symbol of the unity of Hungary having a rainbow.

Research on the crown: the history, how it looks like, which part of it could be used as a marker. Where and how is it stored. How much is to get into the Parliament.
According to the photos, the crown is behind a glass cube, which I think can be a problem for making itself as the marker, because of the reflections. Which is sad and not so elegant. So probably I'll have to find something which is close to it, maybe a description sign, and that is a part of the Parliament itself, so it can't be removed.
I also tried to look up if I can get into prison by using the crown not how it is supposed to be. I reached out to an association offering legal support and advice for people who want to practice their political free speech rights.

They answered from the legal advice association, they said it's a very interesting question. Long story short, I won't get into prison, and I'm not commiting anything illegal. In case I create an app, I have to mention all the safety cautions, like in Pokémon go, that you shouldn't drive during using the app, and pay attention to real life things happening.

looking for rainbow models. this looks kind of how i imagined it.

looking at the space of the crown looking for things that could be markers here.

so far that i can imagine as an option: the kupola itself, the floor pattern. it would be cool if the texture of the marble holding the crown would be it, but it's not too contrasty.

I bought tickets to the parliament, unfortunately they just got more expensive. I'll have a trip on the 24th, when I make as many pictures as possibles, for having the images for markers. I'll have another trip on the 28th, when hopefully at least one of my markers will turn on, and put the rainbow in its correct place. In case something goes wrong, I can still go on the 29th or 30th. I'm a bit afraid of that I will look too suspicious, as one can enter the parliament only with 45 min long guided tours, and the crown is just one stop. In theory, I can make photos, but I'm not sure if in the quantity that I want to.

I talked with Denise about the marker question. She suggested, that I could make more photos about the crown from more angles, and add all these photos as different markers, and tell them that if one is triggered, the others shouldn't turn on. But she also thinks that the reflections of the glass might be problems. She also suggested to look into GPS based solutions, and maybe to put one rainbow above the parliament, which is also a good solution, I'm just very excited about turning a 1000 year old historical object into a marker. 

## 24.09.
I did my first field trip to the parliament. I walked around the parliament to look for possible markers for an outside rainbow. It is not allowed to go close to the building from any direction, which is weird, but maybe not a problem, as I want to make a very big rainbow outside. The designers of the square didn't think too AR marker friendly about the statues and patterns, all the statues are homogeneous. The street signs could be possible options, and also the GPS coordinates, as Denise recommended.
I also went on the guided trip inside the parliament. Very bad news is that it is not allowed to take any pictures in the space of the crown, two guys with swords are telling people not to do so. It is not fully impossible, but if I want users to use the app, it is not ideal.
In the room afterwards, there is a rug, which has a nice pattern, and if one looks back, can secretly make a photo form there. And also the windows could be good markers, they were designed my Miksa Roth, and has very nice patterns, but still. 
I was very disappointed by this fact.
I looked at the parliamental meeting room as well, where one could put a rainbow above our prime minister, and there are some details, which could be used as markers, for example there is a very pretty heating and airing system which has ornamentic lids, and this space is used more actively then the crown space, and it would be fun, if the politicians of the opposition could protest with it, at the same time, this would give an extra meaning to my project, and I prefer if it is stays neutral.
