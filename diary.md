## Beginning of summer
My friend, Gábor Ott, wrote me that he has an idea to create an app which turns any flag into a rainbow flag. I liked the idea, and I asked my classmates if they would want to work on such a thing, but we were busy with 48h NK and Sehsüchte. The idea came back to me more and more often, the worse and worse news I read related to the Hungarian government's LGBTQ laws, and how it increased aggressivity towards people even just putting rainbow flags on their balcony.
With another friend we have been thinking about an AR protest group exhibition for a while, but we are talking a lot, but we enjoy laughing about things more.
